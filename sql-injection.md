# SQL Injection

> Objectives: Understanding SQL injection concepts, understanding various types of SQL injection attacks, understanding SQL injection methodology, SQL injection tools, understanding different IDS evasion techniques, SQL injection countermeasures, SQL injection detection tools

### SQL Injection Concepts

* SQL injection is a technique used to take advantage of non-validated input vulnerabilities to pass SQL commands through a web app for execution by the backend database
* Usually to retrieve information
* This is a flaw in web apps
* Attacker can deface a web page with this attack
* They can add info to your website, extract data, and insert new data

## Types of SQL Injection

* Error based SQL Injection: Attacker puts intentional bad input into app to see the database-level error messages. Uses this to create carefully designed SQL Injections
* Blind SQL Injection: Attacker has no error messages from the system with which to work. Instead, attack simply sends a malicious SQL query to the database
* Whenever you see SELECT, it is probably a SQL command 
* Union SQL command, joining a forged query to the original query 
* Time-Based SQL Injection: evaluates time delay in response to true-false queries

## SQL Injection Methodology

* Information gathering and SQL vulnerability detection
* Attackers analyze web GET and POST requests to identify all input fields
* Afterwards, launch attack
* Advanced SQL injections
* SQL Injection Black Box Pen Testing
* Send single quotes and input data to see where the user input is not sanitized
* Send long strings of junk data to detect buffer overruns 
* Used right square bracket as input data

## Evasion Techniques

* Evading IDS
* Obscure input strings
* Hex Encoding 
* Manipulating whitespace
* Inline Comment
* Char encoding

## Countermeasures

* Use Firewalls on SQL server 
* Make no assumptions about size, type, or content of the data that is received by the application
* Avoid constructing dynamic SQL with concatenated input values
