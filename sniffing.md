### Sniffing Concepts

* Sniffing is a process of monitoring and capturing all data packets passing through a given network using sniffing tools \(form of wire tap\)
  * Many enterprises switch ports are open 
  * Anyone in same physical location can plug into network with ethernet
* How a sniffer works
  * Sniffer turns on the NIC of a system to the promiscuous mode that it listens to all the data transmitted on its segment 
* Each computer has a MAC address and an IP address 
* Passive sniffing means through a hub \(involves sending no packets\), on a hub traffic is sent to all ports 
  * Most modern networks use switches
* Active Sniffing: Searches for traffic on a switched LAN by actively injecting traffic into the LAN. Involves injecting address resolution packets \(ARP\) into the network 
* Protocols vulnerable to sniffing:
  * HTTP, Telnet and Rlogin, POP, IMAP, SMTP and NNTP
* Sniffers operate at the Data Link layer of the OSI model   
* Hardware Protocol Analyzer: equipment that captures signals without altering the traffic in a cable segment 
  * Can be used to monitor traffic. Allows attacker to see individual data bytes
  * Span Port: A port which is configured to receive a copy of every packet that passing through a switch
  * Wiretapping: Process of monitoring telephone and internet convo’s by third party
  * Via connecting a listening device \(hardware or software\) to the circuit 
  * Active Wiretapping: Monitors, records, and injects something into the communication or traffic 
  * Passive Wiretapping:  It only monitors and records the traffic and gain knowledge of the data it contains 
  * Lawful interception: legally intercepting data communication

## MAC Attacks

* Each switch has a fixed size dynamic content addressable memory \(CAM table\)
* CAM table stores information such as MAC address available on physical ports 
* If CAM table is flooded with more MAC address it can hold, then the switch turns into a HUB
* Attackers exploit this 
* Switch Port Stealing: uses mac flooding to sniff the packets
* How to defend against MAC attacks: use a port security to restrict inbound traffic from only a selected set of mac addresses and limit MAC flooding attacks

## DHCP Attacks

* DHCP servers maintain TCP/IP configuration information \(provides leases\)
* DHCP starvation attack: attacker broadcasts forged DHCP requests and tries to lease all DHCP addresses available in the DHCP scope
* As a result, legitimate user is unable to obtain or renew an IP address
* Rogue DHCP: rogue DHCP server in network and responds to DHCP requests with bogus IP addresses 
* How to defend against DHCP starvation and Rogue Server Attack: Enable port security for DHCP starvation, and enable DHCP snooping that allows switch to accept DHCP transactions from a trusted port

## ARP Poisoning

* Address Resolution Protocol \(ARP\) is a stateless protocol used for resolving IP address to machine \(MAC\) addresses 
* All network devices broadcasts ARP queries in the network to find machine’s MAC address
* When one machine needs to communicate with another, it looks up to the ARP table. If it’s not there, the ARP\_REQUEST is broadcasted over the network 
* ARP packets can be forged 
* ARP spoofing involves constructing large number of forged ARP requests 
* Switch is set in ‘forwarding mode’ after the ARP table is flooded with spoofed ARP replies 
* Attackers flood a target computer’s ARP cache with forged entries, which is also known as poisoning 
* ARP spoofing is a method of attacking an ethernet LAN
* Using Fake ARP messages, an attacker can divert all communications between two machines so that all traffic is exchanged via his/her PC
* ARP Tools: Cain & Abel, WinArpAttacker
* How to defend: Implement dynamic ARP inspection, DHCP Snooping, XArp spoofing detection

## Spoofing

* Attacker can sniff network for MAC addresses, then spoof them to receive all the traffic destined for the user. Allows allows attacker to gain access to the network 
* IRDP spoofing: ICMP Router discovery protocol allows host to discover the IP address of active routers. 
* Attacker sends spoofed IRDP router advertisement message to the host on the subnet, causing it to change its default router 
* How to defend: DHCP snooping, Dynamic ARP inspection, IP source guard

## DNS Poisoning

* DNS poisoning is a technique that tricks a DNS server into believing that it has received authentication when it really has not 
* Results in substitution of a false IP address 
* Attacker can create fake DNS entries 
* Intranet DNS spoofing: must be connected to LAN and able to sniff. Works well against switches with ARP poisoning the router. 
* Intranet DNS spoofing attacker infects machine with trojan and changes DNS IP to that of attacker
* Proxy Server DNS poisoning: attacker sends a trojan to machine that changes hosts proxy server settings in internet explorer to that of the attacker’s and redirect to fake website 
* DNS Cache Poisoning: Refers to altering or adding forged DNS records into DNS resolver cache so that a DNS query is redirected to a malicious site
* How to defend: resolve all DNS queries to local DNS server, Block DNS requests from going to external servers, configure firewall to restrict external DNS lookup, Implement IDS and deploy correct, Implement DNSSEC

## Sniffing Tools

* Wireshark

## Counter-Measures

* Restrict physical access
* Use encryption 
* Permanent add MAC address to the gateway to the ARP cache
* Use static IP addresses
* Turn off network ID broadcasts
* Use IPV6 
* Use HTTPS instead of HTTP
* Use switch than Hub 
* Use SFTP instead of FTP

## Sniffing Detection Techniques

* Runs IDS and notice if mac address of certain machines have changed
* Check which machines are running in the promiscuous mode 
* Promiscuous mode allows a network device to intercept and read each network packet
* Only a machine in promiscuous mode cache the ARP information 
* A machine in promiscuous mode replies to the ping message as it has correct information about the host sending a ping request 

## Sniffing Pen Testing

* Sniffing pen test is used to check if the data transmission from an org is secure from sniffing and interception attacks
