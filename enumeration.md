# Enumeration

## Enumeration

### Enumeration Concepts

* In the enumeration phase, attacker creates active connections to system and performs directed queries to gain more information. Uses this information to identify system attack points and perform password attacks
  * Conducted in an intranet environment
* Techniques for Enumeration
  * Extract user names using email IDs 
  * Extract user names using SNMP
  * Extract user groups from windows
  * Extract information using the default passwords
  * Brute force active directions
  * Extract information using DNS Zone Transfer
* Popular Ports to Enumerate
  * TCP/UDP 53 - DNS Zone Transfer
  * TCP/UDP 135 - Microsoft EPC Endpoint Manager
  * UDP 137 - NetBIOS Name Service \(NBNS\)
  * TCP 139 - SMB over NetBIOS
  * TCP/UDP 445 - SMB over TCP \(direct host\)
  * UDP 161 - Simple Network Management Protocol \(SNMP\)
  * TCP/UDP 389 - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol \(LDAP\)
  * TCP/UDP 3268 - Global Catalog Service
  * TCP 25 - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol \(SMTP\)
  * TCP/UDP 162 - SNMP Trap

## NetBIOS Enumeration

* NetBIOS name is a unique 16 ASCII string used to identify the network devices  \(15 of it are device name, 16 is reserved for service or name record type\)
* Nbtstat utility displays NetBIOS over TCP/IP protocol statistics, NetBIOS name tables/cache
* Net View utility is used to obtain a list of all the shared resources of remote hosts or workgroup

## SNMP Enumeration \(simple network Management protocol enumeration\)

* SNMP enumeration is a process of enumerating user accounts and devices on a target system using SNMP 
* SNMP contains a manager and agent. Agends are embedded on every network, manager installed on a seperate computer 
* SNMP has two passwords
  * Attacker uses default community strings to extract info 
  * Uses it to extract information about network resources such as hosts, routers, devices, shares
* Management Information Base \(MIB\)
  * MIB is a virtual database containing formal description of all the network objects managed using SNMP

## LDAP Enumeration

* LDAP is an internet protocol for accessing distributed directory services
* Attacker queries LDAP service to gather information such as valid user names, addresses, departmental details, etc

## NTP Enumeration

* Network Time Protocol \(NTP\) is designed to synchronize clocks of networked computers
* Uses UDP port 123 
* Can use it to find important information on a network
* Can use Nmap, Wireshark

## SMTP and DNS Enumeration

* SMTP has 3 built-in commands
  * VRFY - Validates users
  * EXPN - Tells actual delivery addresses of aliasses and mailing lists
  * RCPT TO - Defines the recipients of the message
* SMTP servers respond differently to these commands 
* Attackers can directly interact with SMTP via the telnet prompt and collect a list of valid users on the SMTP Server

## Enumeration Countermeasures

* SNMP countermeasures
  * Remove SNMP agent on turn off the SNMP service \(block 161\)
  * Change default community string name
  * Upgrade to SNMP3, which encrypts passwords/messages
  * Implement additional security option called “additional restrictions for anonymous connections”
  * Ensure that the access to null session pipes, null session shares, and IPsec filtering are restricted
* DNS countermeasures
  * Disable DNS zone transfers to the untrusted hosts
  * Make sure private hosts and their IP addresses are not published into DNS zone files of public DNS server
  * Use premium DNS registration services to hide sensitive information
  * Use standard network admin contacts for dns registrations in order to avoid social engineering attacks
* SMTP countermeasures
  * Ignore email messages to unknown recipients
  * Disable open relay features
  * Do not include sensitive mail server and local host information in mail responses 
* LDAP countermeasures
  * Restrict access to active directory by using software such as citrix 
  * Enable account lockout 
  * Use SSL technology for LDAP traffic
* Enumeration Pen Testing
  * Used to identify valid user accounts or poorly protected resource shares
  * Information can be users and groups, network resources 
  * Used in combination with data collected in reconnaissance phase
  * Steps in Enumeration Pen Testing
    * Find the network range
    * Calculate the subnet mask
    * Undergo host discovery
    * Perform port scanning 
    * Perform NetBIOS enumeration
    * Perform SNMP enumeration
    * Perform LDAP enumeration
    * Perform NTP enumeration
    * Perform SMTP enumeration
    * Perform DNS enumeration
    * Document all findings
