# Introduction to Ethical Hacking

## Overview

### Terminology

* **Hack Value**: Notion among hackers that something is worth doing or interesting
* **Vulnerability**: Existence of a weakness, design, or implementation error that can   lead to an expected event compromising the security of the system
* **Exploit**: A breach of IT system security through vulnerabilities
* **Payload**: Part of an exploit code that perform the intended malicious action
* **Zero-Day Attack**: An attack that exploits computer app vulnerabilities before the   software developer releases a patch for the vulnerability
* **Daisy Chaining**: Gaining access to one network and/or computer and then using   the same info to gain access to multiple networks and computer that contains   desirable info
* **Doxing**: Publishing personally identifiable information
* **Bot**: software app that can be controlled remotely to execute or automate   pre-defined tasks

### Elements of Information Security

* **Non-Repudiation**: Sender of a message cannot later deny having sent the   message
* **Confidentiality**: Only authorized users able to view content
* **Integrity**: Trustworthiness of data or resource in prevention of unauthorized   changes
* **Availability**: assurance systems are accessible
* **Authenticity**: The quality of being genuine

## Threats and Attack Vectors

* **Cloud computing**: is an on-demand delivery of IT capabilities, and stores data. Must be   secure
* **Advanced Persistent Threats**: APT focus on stealing info from victim machine w/o user   aware
* **Viruses and Worms**: Capable of infecting a network within seconds
* **Mobile Threats**: Many attackers see mobile phone as a way to gain access
* **Botnet**: huge network of compromised systems
* **Insider Attack**: an attack performed on a corporate network by an entrusted person w/  access
* **Threat categories**: 
  * Network Threats
  * Host Threats
  * Application Threats
* **Types of Attacks:** 
  * OS Attacks
  * Mis-Config attacks
  * App Level Attacks, 
  * Shrink Wrap Code     Attacks

## Hacking Concepts, Types, Phases

> Hacking: Exploiting system vulnerabilities and compromising security

### Five Phases of Hacking: 

* **Reconnaissance** -  Preparation phase when an attacker seeks to gather information Does not directly interact with the system, and relies on social engineering and public info.
* **Scanning** - Identify specific vulnerabilities \(in-depth probing\) Using Port scanners to 

  detect listening ports \(companies should shut down ports that are not required\)

* **Gaining Access** - Using vulnerabilities identified during reconnaissance \[DoS, Logic/Time 

  Exploit, reconfiguring/crashing system\]

* **Maintaining   Access** -  Keeping a low profile, keeping system as a launch pad, etc
* **Clearing Tracks** - Hiding malicious acts while continuing to have access, avoiding 

  suspicion



## Security Controls

### Information Assurance

### Threat Modeling

1. Identify Security    Objectives 
2. Application overview 
3. Decompose Application 
4. Identify Threats 
5. Identify Vulnerabilities 

### Network Security Zoning \(High to Low\)

* Internet Zone
* Internet DMZ
* Production   Network Zone
* Intranet Zone
* Management Network Zone 

### Security Policies

> Information security policy defines basic requirements and rules to be implemented in order to protect and secure organizations information systems.

#### 4 Types of Security Policies

* Promiscuous Policy 
* Permissive Policy 
* Prudent Policy 
* Paranoid Policy

### Vulnerability Assessments

#### Types of Assessments

* Active Assessments 
* Passive Assessments 
* Host-Based assessment 
* Internal Assessment 
* External Assessment 
* Application Assessments 
* Network Assessments 
* Wireless Network Assessments

#### Methodology of Assessments

* Acquisition 
* Identification 
* Analyzing 
* Evaluation
* Reports

### Penetration Testing

> Penetration Testing: Simulating an attack to find out vulnerabilities

* Blue Team: Detect and Mitigate  
* Red Team: Attack w/ limited access w/ or w/o warning

#### Types of Penetration Testing

* Black-Box \(no prior knowledge\)
* White-Box \(complete knowledge\) 
* Grey-Box \(limited knowledge\)

#### Security Testing Methodologies

* OWASP
* NIST

## Security Laws and Standards

### United States

#### Laws

* **Sarbanes Oxley Act \(SOX\)** -Protect investors and public by increasing reliability of 

  corporate disclosures

* **Digital Millennium Copyright Act \(DMCA\)** - Protects intellectual property
* **Gramm-Leech Bliley Act \(GLBA\)** - Controls use of personal financial data
* **Health Information Portability and Protection Act \(HIPPA\)** - Privacy for medical records
* **Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act \(FERPA\)** - Protection for education records
* **Federal Information Security Management Act \(FISMA\)** - Government networks must have security standards

#### Standards

* Payment card Industry Data Security Standard \(PCI-DSS\) -Payment Systems



### Europe

#### Laws

* Computer Misuse Act of 1990 -  Addresses hacking activities
* Human Rights Act of 1990 - Ensures Privacy
