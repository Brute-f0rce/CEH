# Denial of Service

> Objectives: Overview of DOS attacks and DDoS attacks, understanding the techniques of DoS/DDoS Attack Techniques, Understanding the Botnet Network, Understanding Various DoS and DDoS attack tools, DoS/DDoS countermeasures, Overview of DoS attack penetration testing

### DoS/DDoS Concepts

* Denial of Service \(DoS\) is an attack on a computer or network that reduces, restricts or prevents accessibility of system resource to its legitimate users
* Attackers flood a victim system with non-legitimate service requests 
* DDoS attack involves a multitude of compromised systems attacking a single targeted system \(botnet\)

## DoS/DDoS Attack Techniques

* Basic categories of the attacks
  * Volumetric Attacks: consumes the bandwidth of the target network or service 
  * Fragmentation: overwhelms targetâ€™s ability of reassembling fragmented packets
  * TCP state-exhaustion attack: consumes connection state table present such as load balancers ,firewalls, app servers
  * Application layer attack: consumes app resources or service making it unavailable to other legitimate users 
  * SYN Attack
    * Attacker sends a large number of SYN request to target server 
    * Target machine sends back a SYN ACK in response to the request waiting for the ACK to complete session
    * Attacker never sends ack 
  * ICMP flood attack: type of DoS where perpetrators send a large number of ICMP packets causing the system to stop responding to legitimate TCP/IP requests 
    * To protect yourself: set a threshold limit that invokes a ICMP protection feature
  * Peer to Peer Attack: attackers instruct clients of p2p file sharing hubs to disconnect for their p2p network and connect to victims fake website. Attackers can launch massive DoS attacks and compromise websites
  * Permanent Denial-of-Service Attack: Also known as phlashing, refers to attacks that cause irreversible damage to system hardware
    * Unlike other DoS attacks,, it sabotages the system hardware 
  * Application-Level Flood Attack: Application-level flood attacks results in the loss of services 
    * Using this attack , attackers exploit weaknesses in programming source code to prevent in the application from processing legitimate requests
  * Distributed Reflection Denial of Service \(DRDoS\)
    * Also known as a spoofed attack, involves the use of multiple intermediary and secondary machines that contribute to the actual DDoS attack against the target machine or application

## Botnets

* Bots are software applications that run-automated tasks over the internet 
* A botnet is a huge network of compromised systems and can be used by an attacker to launch a DoS attack
* Scanning Methods for Finding Vulnerable Machines: Random Scanning, Hit-list scanning, topological scanning, local subnet scanning, permutation scanning 
* DoS and DDoS attack tools
* LOIC, GoldenEye

## Countermeasures

* Techniques 
  * Activity Profiling
    * Increases in activity levels, distinct clusters, average packet rate etc
  * Changepoint detection
    * Filters network traffic by IP addresses, targeted port numbers, stores traffic flow data in a graph that shows the traffic flow rate vs time 
  * Wavelet-based signal analysis
    * Analyzes network traffic in terms of spectral components. Divides incoming signal into various frequencies for analyzation
* DoS/DDoS countermeasure strategies 
  * Absorbing the attack \(requiring additional resources\)
  * Degrading services \(identify critical services and stop non-critical\)
  * Shutting down the services
  * Deflect Attacks: Honeypots act as an enticement for an attacker. Serve as a means for gaining information about attackers, stores their activities 
  * Ingress filtering: protects from flooding attacks. Enables originator be traced to its true source
  * Egress Filtering: scanning packet headers of IP address leaving a network. Ensures unauthorized or malicious traffic never leaves the internal network 
  * Mitigate Attack: Load balancing, throttling
* Post-Attack Forensics 
  * Analyze traffic patterns for new filtering techniques, analyze router, firewall, and IDS logs , can update load-balancing and throttling countermeasures
