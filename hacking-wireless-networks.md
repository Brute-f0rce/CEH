### Wireless Concepts

* GSM: universal system used for mobile transportation for wireless network worldwide
* Bandwidth: Describes amount of information that may be broadcasted over a connection
* BSSID: The MAC address of an access point that has set up a basic service set
* ISM band: a set of frequency for the international industrial, scientific, and medical communities
* Access Point: Used to connect wireless devices to a wireless network
* Hotspot: Places where wireless network is available for public use 
* Association: Process of connecting a wireless device to an access point 
* Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing: method of encoding digital data on multiple carrier frequencies 
* Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum: original data signal is multiplied with a pseudo random noise spreading code
* Frequency-hopping spread spectrum \(FHSS\): Method of transmitting radio signals rapidly switching a carrier among many frequency channels 
* Wireless Networks
* WiFi refers to IEEE 802.11 standard
* * SSID \(service set identifier\)
* Open System Authentication Process: in open system, any wireless client that wants to access a WiFi networks sends a request to the wireless AP for authentication.
* Shared Key Authentication Process: in this process, each wireless station receives a shared secret key over a secure channel that is distinct from the 802.11 comm channels.
* Centralized Authentication server \(RADIUS\)
  * WiFi Chalking
  * WarChalking: draw symbols in public places to advertise open Wi-Fi networks
  * Types of Wireless Antennas
  * Directional Antennas: Used to broadcast and obtain radio waves from a single direction
  * Omni-Directional Antennas: provides 360 degrees horizontal broadcasts, used in wireless base stations
  * Parabolic Grid Antenna: Based on the idea of a satellite dish. Can pick up Wi-Fi signals ten miles or more 
  * Yagi Antenna: unidirectional antenna
  * Dipole Antenna: Bi-Directional Antenna, used to support client connection rather than site-to-site applications
  * Parabolic grid antennas let attackers attack from from farther away \(10 miles!\)

## Wireless Encryption

* WEP \(wired equivalent privacy\): weakest encryption. Uses 24-bit initialization vector. A 64 bit WEP uses a 40 bit key etc
* Can use Cain & Abel to crack
* WPA \(Wifi Protected Access\): Stronger encryption with TKIP.
* You can brute force the keys offline
* You can defend by using stronger passphrases
* WPA2: Stronger data protection with AES
* WPA-2 personal uses a pre-shared key to protect access
* WPA-2 Enterprise includes EAP or RADIUS for centralized authentication w/kerberos etc

## Wireless Threats

* Access Control Attacks: Aims to penetrate a network by evading WLAN access control measures, such as AP MAC filters and Wi-Fi port access controls
* Integrity Attacks: Sending forged control management or data frames over a wireless network
* Confidentiality Attacks: attempt to intercept confidential information sent over wireless associations
* Availability Attacks: DoS
* Authentication Attacks: Steal the identity of Wi-Fi clients, their PI, logins, etc. to unauthorized access of network resources
* Rogue Access Point Attack: Hijacking connections and acting as a middle man sniffing 
* Client Mis-Association: Attacker sets up a rogue access point outside of the corporate perimeter and lures the employees of the organization to connect with it 
* Misconfigured Access Point Attack: Accidents for configurations that you can exploit
* AD Hoc connection attack: Wifi Clients communicate directly in ad-hoc and do not require AP to relay packet. Attack can attack OS direct since the encryption is weak
* Honeyspot Access Point Attack: Attacker takes advantage of multiple WLANâ€™s in area and use same SID 
* AP MAC Spoofing: Hacker spoofs the MAC address of the WLAN client equipment to mask an authorized client 
* Jamming Signal Attack: High gain amplifier 

## Wireless Hacking Methodology

1. WiFi Discovery: discovers the WiFi network
2. GPS Mapping: Attackers create a map of discovered Wi-Fi network and create a database
3. Wireless Traffic Analysis: identify vulnerabilities, WiFi reconnaissance, Tools for Packet Capture & Analysis
4. Launch Wireless Attacks
   1. Fragmentation Attack: can obtain 1500 bytes of PRGA data that can be used for injection attacks
   2. Mac Spoofing: attackers change MAC address to that of an authenticated user to bypass the MAC filtering configured in an access point 
   3. Denial of Service: Deauthentication and Disassociation attacks
   4. Man in the middle attack MITM : Attacker spoofs his MAC, sends a deAuth requests and then puts himself in the middle
   5. Wireless ARP poisoning attack: 
   6. Rogue Access Point: Wireless APs attacker installs on a network without authorization and are not under management of the network administrator. Are not configured with any security
   7. Evil Twin: Replicates another wireless APs name via common SSID
5. Crack Wi-Fi encryption
   1. Crack WEP using Aircrack
   2. Crack WPA-PSK using aircrack
   3. WEP cracking using Cain & Abel
6. Compromise the Wi-Fi Network
   * What is spectrum analysis
   * RF spectrum analyzers examine Wi-Fi radio transmissions and measure power \(amplitude\)
   * Employ statistical analysis to plot spectral usage
   * Can be used for DoS attack

## Bluetooth Hacking

* Exploitation of Bluetooth Stack implementation vulnerabilities
* Bluesmacking: DoS attack which overflows Bluetooth-enabled devices with random packets causing device to crash
* Bluejacking: sending unsolicited messages over bluetooth to bluetooth-enabled devices such as mobile phones, laptops, etc
* Bluesnarfing: Theft of information from a wireless device through a bluetooth connection
  * Blue Sniff: Proof of concept code for a bluetooth wardriving utility 
  * Bluebugging: remotely accessing the bluetooth-enabled devices and using its features
  * BluePrinting: collecting information about bluetooth enabled devices such as manufacturer, device model, firmware
  * MAC spoofing attack: intercepting data intended for other bluetooth enabled devices 
  * MITM: Modifying data between bluetooth enabled devices communication on a piconet 
  * Bluetooth Modes:
  * Discoverable, Limited Discoverable \(timed\), Non-discoverable
  * Pairing Modes
  * Non-pairable models: rejects every pairing request
  * Pairable mode: will pair upon request

## Countermeasures

* How to defend against bluetooth hacking
  * Use non-regular patterns such as PIN keys
  * Keep device in non-discoverable mode
  * Keep a check of all paired devices
  * Always enable encryptions

## Wireless Security Tools

* Wireless Intrusion Prevention Systems
