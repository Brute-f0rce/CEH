# System Hacking

## System Hacking

### Information at hand before system hacking stage

1. Footprinting: IP range, Namespace, Employees
2. Scanning module: target assessment, identified systems, identified services
3. Enumeration: Intrusive probing, user lists, security flaws

### System Hacking Goals:

1. Gaining Access - password cracking, social engineering
2. Escalating Privileges \(get other passwords\) - exploiting known system vulnerabilities
3. Executing Applications \(backdoors\) - Trojans, Spywares, Backdoors, Keyloggers
4. Hiding Files - Rootkits, Steganography
5. Covering Tracks - Clearing logs

## Cracking Passwords

* Password cracking techniques are used to recover passwords from computer systems
* Attackers use password cracking techniques to gain unauthorized access
* Most cracks are successful due to guessable passwords
* Types of password attacks 
  * Non-electronic attacks: Attacker does not need technical knowledge to crack password \(looking at keyboard/screen, convincing people, trash bins etc\)
  * Active Online Attacks: Attacker performs cracking by directly communicating with the victim machine \(dictionary, brute force, rule based - some info known\)
  * Passive Online Attacks: Performs cracking without communicating with party
  * Offline Attack: attacker copies password file and tried to crack it 
* Default passwords are set by the manufacturer
* Trojans can collect usernames and passwords and send to attacker, run in background
* Can use USB drive for a physical approach
* Hash Injection Attack: attacker injects compromised hash into local session then use it to validate network resource. Finds and extracts a logged on domain admin account hash
* Passive Online Attack: Wire Sniffing 
  * Packet Sniffer tools on LAN 
  * Capture data may include sensitive information such as passwords
  * Sniffed credentials are used to gain unauthorized access
* Rainbow table attack 
  * Precomputed table which contains word lists like dictionary files, brute force lists, and their hash values 
  * Compare the hashes 
  * Easy to recover passwords by comparing captured password hashes to precomputed tables
* Offline Attack: Distributed Network Attack \(DNA\)
  * A DNA technique is used for recovering passwords from hashes or password protected files using the unused processing power of machines across the network to decrypt passwords
* Microsoft Authentication
  * Windows stores passwords in the Security Accounts Manager \(SAM\) Database, or in the Active Directory database in domains. They are hashed.
  * NTLM Authentication
    * NTLM authentication protocol types 
    * LM authentication protocol
    * These protocols stores user’s password in the SAM database using different hashing methods 
  * Kerberos Authentication
    * Microsoft has upgraded its default authentication protocol
  * Password Salting
    * Random strings of characters are added to the password before calculating their hases
      * Advantage: salting makes it more difficult to reverse hashes 
* Use password crackers like L0phtCrack, Cain&Abel, RainbowCrack
* Enable SYSKEY with strong password to encrypt and protect the SAM database

## Escalating Privileges

* An attacker can gain access to the network using a non-admin user account, next step is to gain admin privileges 
* Privilege Escalation Using DLL Hijacking
  * If attackers place a malicious DLL in the application directory, it will be executed in place of the real DLL
* Resetting passwords using command prompt
  * An admin can reset passwords while an administrator
* Countermeasures: restrict interactive login privileges, use least privilege policy, implement multi-factor, run services as unprivileged accounts, patch systems regularly, use encryption technique, reduce amount of code, perform debugging

## Executing Applications

* Attackers execute malicious programs remotely in the victim's machine to gather information
  * Backdoors
  * Crackers
  * Keyloggers
  * Spyware
* Software like RemoteExec can remotely install software, execute programs/scripts
* There are hardware and software keystroke loggers \(USB vs App\)
* Spyware
  * Records user’s interaction
  * Hides its process
  * Hidden component of freeware program
  * Gather info about victim or organization
* GPS spyware also exists
* Countermeasures for Keyloggers
  * Pop-up blocker
  * anti-spyware/virus
  * Firewall software
  * Anti-keylogging software
  * Recognize phishing emails and delete
  * Choose new passwords for different online accounts
  * Avoid opening junk emails
* There are Anti-keyloggers out there
* Rootkits are programs that hide their presence and an attacker's malicious activities, granting them full access to the server or host at the time or in future
  * Typical Rootkit has backdoor programs, DDos  programs, packet sniffers, log-wiping utilities, IRC bots, etc
* 6 Types of Rootkits
  * Hypervisor Level Rootkit: Acts as hypervisor and modifies boot sequence of the computer to load the host OS as a virtual machine. 
  * Boot Loader level rootkit: replaces original boot loader with one controlled by attacker
  * Hardware/Firmware Rootkit: Hides in hardware devices or platform firmware which is not inspected for code integrity
  * Application level rootkit: replaces regular application binaries with fake trojan, or modifies the behavior of existing applications
  * Kernel Level Rootkit: Adds malicious code or replaces original OS kernel and device driver codes
  * Library Level Rootkits: Replaces original system calls with fake ones to hide information about attacker
* Detecting Rootkits
  * Integrity-Based detection: compares a snapshot of the filesystem,boot records, or memory
  * Signature-based technology: compares characteristics of all system processes and executable files with a database of known rootkit fingerprints
  * Heuristic/Behavior based detection: any deviations in the systems normal activity
  * Runtime Execution path profiling: compares runtime execution paths of all system processes before and after rootkit infection
  * Cross View-Based detection: enumerates key elements in the computer system such as system files, processes, and registry keys and compares them to an algorithm to generate a similar data set that does not rely on common APIs
* NTFS Data Stream
  * NTFS alternate data stream \(ADS\) is a windows hidden stream which contains metadata for the file such as attributes, word count, author name, access and modification time of files
  * Using NTFS stream, an attacker can almost completely hide files within the system.
  * You can hide a file side another file \(trojan in a readme.txt\)
  * Countermeasures: use a third party file integrity checker
* Steganography
  * Steganography is a technique of hiding a secret message within an ordinary message and extracting it at the destination
  * Utilizing a graphic image as a cover is the most popular method to conceal the data in files 
  * Attackers can use steganography to hide messages such as list of compromised servers, source code for the hacking tools, plans for future attacks, etc
  * Technical Steganography: invisible ink/microdots, physical methods to hide
  * Linguistic Steganography: Type that hides the message in another file
    * Semagrams: use of symbols to hide information
  * Least Significant bit insertion: The rightmost bit of a pixel is called the LSB
  * Masking and Filtering: Making technique hides data similar to watermarks on actual paper. Can be detection with simple statistical analysis. Mostly in grayscale images.
  * Algorithms and Transformation
    * Hide data in mathematical functions used in compression algorithms
    * Data is embedded by changing the coefficients of a transform of an image
  * Audio steganography - information in hidden frequency
* Steganalysis
  * Art of discovering and rendering covert messages using steganography. It attacks steganography efforts

## Covering Tracks

* Techniques used for covering tracks 
  * Disable Auditing: disabling audit features of target system
  * Clearing logs: attacker clears/delete the system log entries for their activities
  * Manipulating logs: Manipulates logs in a way they won't be caught in legal actions 
* If system is exploited with metasploit, attacker uses meterpreter shell to wipe logs

## Penetration Testing

* Password Cracking
* Privilege Escalation
* Execute Applications
* Hiding Files
* Covering Tracks
